## Doesn't show that encouragement lead to an increase in post-test scores for letters (in fact has a negative slope).

fit2 <- lm(formula = postnumb ~ viewenc, data=sesame)
display(fit2)
## Same for post-test scores for numbers. 

ggplot(sesame, aes(x=postnumb, y=postlet, color=(as.factor(viewenc)))) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm")

fit4 <- lm(formula = postlet ~ regular, data=sesame)
display(fit4)
## The effect of actually watching Sesame Street regularly does have a significant correlation with improved post-test scores for letters, with a coeffecient estimate of 12.69. This model does have a low R-squared though.

fit5 <- lm(formula = postnumb ~ regular, data=sesame)
display(fit5)
## Similarly, watching Sesame Street also has a high correlation with improved post-test scores for numbers, although again with a low r-squared.

ggplot(sesame, aes(x=postnumb, y=postlet, color=(as.factor(regular)))) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm")

## c ## 
## I don't think either of the two previous estimates can be used to give causal interpretation. Neither explains very much of the variation in the data.

## I developed a correlation matrix and then cut it down to the first nine factors, 
## which were all that had eigenvalues greater than or equal to 1. 
## The fit was still 0.96 so it still could reproduce the original correlation matrix fairly well. 
##
## The top three questions for PC1 were Q26, Q28, and Q23, all with values over 0.7. 
## Each of these questions come from the survey bank measuring "attitude toward TTU". 
## Results for PC2 were more spread out, but Q30 and Q34, from the "attitude toward web site" bank, 
## scored highest. For PC3, the first question bank, on "ease of finding information", 
## was most important. Q9 and Q11 had high negative loadings for PC4, and Q12 had a high positive loading. 
## The “web design” bank had the highest loadings for PC5, and “web design” had high negative loadings for PC7. 
## PC6, 8, and 9 were scattered across the survey banks. This matrix makes up 1.00 of the cumulative proportion 
## but only 0.61 of cumulative variance.
